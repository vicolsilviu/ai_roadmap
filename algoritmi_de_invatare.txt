Some popular groups of models provided by scikit-learn include:

Clustering: for grouping unlabeled data such as KMeans.
Cross Validation: for estimating the performance of supervised models on unseen data.
Datasets: for test datasets and for generating datasets with specific properties for investigating model behavior.
Dimensionality Reduction: for reducing the number of attributes in data for summarization, visualization and feature selection such as Principal component analysis.
Ensemble methods: for combining the predictions of multiple supervised models.
Feature extraction: for defining attributes in image and text data.
Feature selection: for identifying meaningful attributes from which to create supervised models.
Parameter Tuning: for getting the most out of supervised models.
Manifold Learning: For summarizing and depicting complex multi-dimensional data.
Supervised Models: a vast array not limited to generalized linear models, discriminate analysis, naive bayes, lazy methods, neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees.
